          <p>
            Hey, I’m <strong>0ctane</strong> — a final-year school student trying to learn ethical hacking,binary reverse engineering and forensics.
            <br />
            <strong>Voidstack</strong> is my first proper web project — a simple, free platform to help others get
            started without the chaos I went through.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I first got into this space, I spent more time finding good resources than actually learning. It felt
            like every path was either paywalled, too surface-level, or just clickbait. I built Voidstack so no one else
            has to waste that time. It’s not perfect — and I’m still learning — but it’s real.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">what I’ve done so far</h2>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Built this entire site from scratch using Jekyll, GitHub Pages, TailwindCSS, and deployed a separate
              Vite version with Netlify</li>
            <li>Configured my own custom DNS records, reverse proxy setups, and Cloudflare protection</li>
            <li>Self-hosted media servers like Jellyfin, private web apps, and development environments</li>
            <li>Set up basic CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions for deployments</li>
            <li>Used Docker for containerized services and dabbled with VMs for isolated testing</li>
            <li>Comfortable with Java, Bash scripting, and Linux server management</li>
            <li>Learning my way through Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and CTF platforms — documenting every step here</li>
            <li>Planning a full Raspberry Pi-based homelab, internal networking, AD setup, and maybe even a personal VPN
              and logging stack</li>
            <li>And yeah, when I’m not knee-deep in configs and exploits, I occasionally queue up for CS2 Premier and
              try to clutch a round or two</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">why this exists</h2>
          <p>
            I’m not here to sell anything or pretend I know everything — because I don’t. I’m still learning every day.
            This site is part of that process.
            <br />
            If it helps even one beginner avoid the confusion I faced — mission complete.
          </p>
